# Layer 5a — the pre-launch sweep

> **Status: IN PROGRESS.** Started 2026-08-31, after Layer G merged as `f1b6d4d` and every
> earlier audit layer closed. Expected to run across 2–4 sessions by owner agreement.
>
> **This file is the worklist and the findings ledger.** It exists because the sweep is
> longer than one session's context, and because the Layer G audit has already been bitten
> twice by the opposite arrangement: a finding recorded once, fixed under a different
> number, and left reading as open for over a week (F-002, F-007). **A sweep whose state
> lives only in a conversation has no state.**

## What the owner asked for

> *"I want a full complete sweep of everything is correct or not. Ensure you check everything
> for every edge cases. This is the final check we are doing before launching. So, I want this
> to be very thorough."*

> *"I want you to visually see each and every page and confirm if everything is rendering the
> way it should be rendered. I want you to do special attentions to colors for each and every
> state and edge cases. I have already noticed things that are wrong in terms of coloring. But
> you do your own sweep and we can go from there."*

⚠️ **The owner has already spotted colour defects and has deliberately NOT said which.** This
sweep is therefore run *blind* on purpose, so the two readings are independent. Being told
what to look for would turn a search into a confirmation — and a confirmation finds exactly
one thing. **Do not ask which ones until this sweep's colour pass is finished and written
down.**

## Scope decisions — owner, 2026-08-31

| Decision | Consequence for this sweep |
|---|---|
| **375px on PUBLIC pages → FIX** | Mobile defects on the public site are in scope and get fixed here |
| **375px on SIGNED-IN pages → note and move on** | Layer H owns it. The `(app)` shell has a known ~130px overflow, already triaged and measured there. Record anything new, fix nothing |
| **Vercel Hobby → Pro** | Deferred by the owner. Still the launch blocker; not this sweep's job |
| **`KpiStrip` / `ThesisInsights` "favourable"** | Ruled 2026-08-31: **leave as they are.** Do not re-raise |

## ⚠️ Method — the things that make this sweep worth running

Written down first because every one of them is a lesson this project has already paid for,
and because a sweep that ignores them produces a clean report about nothing (CLAUDE.md 14g).

**1 · Measure colour, never eyeball it.** Read what the browser computed (`getComputedStyle`)
and compare against the token the element is supposed to use. A stale copy of the palette
renders *perfectly* — that is precisely how `compositionRamp()` painted the pre-August colours
under every Overall score for a month (11c-viii). A screenshot cannot see it, and neither can
a person. ⚠️ And **derive the finding from a number, not a picture of a picture**: a
downscaled screenshot once had me report a generated image as broken when the bytes were
fine (11o).

**2 · Judge a colour where it SITS.** A badge measured 4.73:1 on white and 4.32:1 on the page
ground; the badge did not change, what was behind it did (11l). Also: `background:` shorthand
resets `background-color` to transparent, so anything asking the DOM what is behind white text
on a gradient reads straight through to the page and reports ~1.1:1.

**3 · Ask what a local fix does to the SET.** Never *"is this colour legible?"*, always *"how
far is it from its neighbours after this?"* Fixing three tiers in isolation put Cautious and
Bearish 10.7 apart and the owner caught it by looking (11t).

**4 · The paid analysis CANNOT be measured on this machine.** `/api/cycle` is a Vercel Python
function and `next start` does not serve it, so on a local production build the whole cycle
block renders nothing — no rating, no verdict, not even the free "Current Drawdown". A sweep
run there comes back clean **having looked at nothing** (11v). Anything touching scores, the
verdict, the scorecard or the report is checked on a **deployed preview**.

**5 · `:3200`, never `:3000`.** The dev server's CSS lies. `:3200` runs `start:fresh`
(`pnpm build && next start`) so it cannot serve a stale build — but `preview_start` will
REUSE a running `:3200` without rebuilding, so the guarantee is on a fresh start only (11o).

**6 · A missing thing renders perfectly.** A section that simply is not there looks
deliberate; there is no error and no gap. So enumerate what SHOULD be present and check for
it by name, rather than looking at the page and asking whether anything is wrong (11j).

**7 · A guard/probe written five minutes ago has never been observed failing**, so a pass
from it carries no information. Give it the case that must fail first (11p).

## Route inventory — derived from the filesystem, not from memory

22 route files, three error boundaries. Dynamic routes expand as shown.

### Public (13 + 17 dynamic)
| Route | Notes |
|---|---|
| `/` | landing, 8 sections, real Mag 7 figures |
| `/pricing` | monthly↔annual toggle; signed-in redirects to `/account` |
| `/contact` | server action → Resend |
| `/learn` | index |
| `/learn/[slug]` | **×12 articles**, 3 illustrations |
| `/articles` | index |
| `/articles/[slug]` | **×5 articles**, frozen figures, ranked tables, custom figures |
| `/terms` `/privacy` `/disclaimer` | contents rail + scroll-spy |
| `/login` `/signup` `/reset-password` | `force-dynamic`, must work with **no JS** |
| `/account/update-password` | recovery-confined, **logo-only chrome** |
| `/deletion-requested` | marker-gated, signed-out only |
| `/reactivate` | deletion-confined, **logo-only chrome** |

### Signed in (6 + universe)
| Route | Notes |
|---|---|
| `/stocks` | Browse |
| `/stocks/[market]/[ticker]` | **34 components**; 3 markets; the paid surface |
| `/run` `/results` | the screener — entirely premium |
| `/request` | ticker request |
| `/account` | profile, billing, delete, referrals |

### Boundaries
`app/not-found.tsx` (auth-aware) · `app/error.tsx` · `app/(app)/error.tsx`

## The six passes

Each pass produces findings in the ledger below. Nothing on a paid surface is changed
without the owner ruling on it first (11l).

- [ ] **P1 · Renders, in every state.** 9 viewer states × every route.
- [ ] **P2 · Colour, measured.** Tier palette across all 4 surfaces; 3-tier health ramp; the
      drawdown tint that runs green for a deeper fall; direction-as-text; the legacy-contrast
      subtree; the new red delisting banner.
- [ ] **P3 · It works when used.** Every form, every control, keyboard-only, the screener end
      to end, sign-up → sign-out.
- [ ] **P4 · Data edge cases.** No cycle at horizon · cross-currency · a bank · no dividend ·
      no analyst coverage · no insider activity · retired ticker · unknown ticker/market/slug ·
      empty results · a brand-new account with no history.
- [ ] **P5 · Not-the-screen.** The downloadable report (a separate esbuild build — it shipped
      blank for four days once, 11d) · every email · metadata + share cards · robots/sitemap/
      canonicals · security headers.
- [ ] **P6 · 375px.** Public = fix. Signed-in = note only.

## Findings ledger

*Nothing recorded yet — the sweep has not started. Findings are numbered `5A-nnn` and each
carries: what was measured, what it should be, and whether it is mine to fix or the owner's
to rule on.*

| # | Pass | Severity | Where | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| — | — | — | — | *(none yet)* | — |

## Session log

| Session | Date | Passes covered | Findings |
|---|---|---|---|
